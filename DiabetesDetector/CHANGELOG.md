Started using a processed dataset from Kaggle to learn how to use a Support Vector Classifier. This dataset provided a good foundation for understanding the application of SVM in diabetes detection. Initial results showed need further tuning and validation are required.

Attempted to use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) because the dataset was imbalanced. Although the accuracy decreased, the confusion matrix became much more balanced, indicating better performance in identifying both positive and negative cases. Further experimentation with different parameters and techniques is planned to improve overall model performance.
