<h1>House Price Predictor</h1>
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>I got my data from the United Kingdom government datasets.</p>
<p>There is just over 141,000 rows in the data set ranging from 1995-2024</p>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-january-2024">Here</a>
<br />
<h2>Pre-Processing</h2>
<p>I split the data 70/30 for training and testing.</p>
<p>When the user selects an area it will only use data from that area in it's calculations</p>
<h2>Data Understanding and visualisation</h2>
<p>To visualise the data I created a scatter plot graph.</p>
<p>I noticed during a major drop during 2008 during the market crash and a minor drop during the 202 covid pandemic.</p>
<br />
<h2>alghorithms</h2>
<p>I chose to use a linear regression model as house prices have steadily increased over the years</p>
